VERSION : 0.0.0.4

New
- Bvh parsing of Skin & Animations

Changes
- Animator has inPlaceScale to set which axes to zero out for inPlace Animation, before it would zero out Y Axis for Mixamo Animations
- IKChain.bindAltDirections, effectorDir & poleDir are option, so can call this method to modify just one direction instead of both.
- BipedIKPose has inPlace & inPlaceScale added to cancel out hip position change changes

VERSION : 0.0.0.3

New
- Armature object can be cloned
- New IK Solvers:
  - ArcSolver
  - ArcSinSolver
  - PistonSolver
  - SpringSolver
  - TrapezoidSolver

  - FabrikSolver
  - NaturalCCDSolver
  - CatenarySolver
- BabylonJS Examples
- ReadyPlayerMe : Loading & TPose Generation
- Quadruped IK Rig ( Prototype )
- Bone Slots : Attachment locations to bones
- IK Animation Additives

Changes
- Bone.pidx is no longer nullable. -1 is used to denote there is no parent
- Pose.getWorldTransform & getWorldRotation handles bIdx == -1 by returning Pose.offset value.
- SwingTwistSolver doesn't apply twist if pole direction is all zeros
- BoneSprings setRestPose has a parameter to not reset the current springs velocity and position.

Fixes
- Update the codebase to handle the Bone.pidx change.
- Bug in BoneSprings where reset is called, it was zeroing out the input data which caused issues.
